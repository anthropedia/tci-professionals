    <summary><h2>Adding a Client or Clients</h2></summary>
    <p>
      You will have to enter your client’s full name email address, gender, and year of birth. Gender and year of birth information are collected to allow for better analysis of your client’s data.<br>
      You will then have to select the test language and the test country. The test country determines which norms are used to score the test, so you should choose the country with which your client identifies culturally.
    </p>
    <p>
    The “Personal Notes” section is optional.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Groups: If you would like to add your client to a group or groups, simply write down the name of the group (e.g., “NY Clients”). This will allow you to isolate members of a particular group or groups from your global client list on your dashboard.</li>
      <li>Notes: This field allows you to record any general information about the client that you would like to remember.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    It is possible to delete inactive clients, but keep in mind that if you do so, you will lose all their data.

    <summary><h2>Assigning Credits to a Client</h2></summary>
    <p>You are able to delete unused credits from a client’s profile, and the credits will reappear in your balance.</p>
    <p>
    Click on the client's name from your dashboard to open their profile. From there, you will be able to assign a test by clicking the "Assign a New Test" button in the right-hand panel. This will generate a unique link to the TCI, which you can either email directly to your client or open up on your computer for them to take in-person. Once the client has completed that test, the link will no longer be active.</p>
    <p>
      Please keep in mind that it is not possible for your client to save the test, so they will need to do it in one sitting or else they will have to start again from the beginning.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h2>Accessing a Client’s Results</h2></summary>
    <p>
    You will receive an automatically generated email once your client has finished the test, and you will be able to view the results by going to their profile, which you can access from your dashboard. Once in their profile, just click on the link of the analysis you’d like to view (i.e., 1D, 2D, or 3D).</p>
    <p>
    Remember that if you’d like to have access to the resilience report (3D+), unity and separateness report (U/S), or validity and performance (V/P), you will have to purchase additional credits.
